1.1 - The History of Java

    generics were added in 2004 for Java J2SE 5.0 (1.5)

1.2 - Principles and components of Java

Principles of Java
    -Simple, object-oriented, and familiar
    -Robust and secure
    -Architecture-neutral and portable
    -High-performance
    -Interpreted, threaded, and dynamic

Java is a consistent language

Understand three OO concepts to understand Java project design:
    encapsulation,
    inheritance, and
    polymorphism

Java is compiled to bytecode, not machinecode.
    This means that any system with a JVM can read a compiled Java program

Java Development Kit (JDK) contains four tools for compiling and packaging Java:
    java: runtime
    javac: compiler
    javadoc: docs builder
    jar: archive builder

    These tools are important to know if you run and compile java code from the
    command line
